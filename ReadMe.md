##Usage

## Requirements
<a id="requirements"></a>
The code is platform independent and was tested on Linux and Windows environments.

The following software must be available to execute the program:

- Java 11 (JDK mandatory for compilation OpenJDK recommended)
- Apache Maven (mandatory for compilation)

It is recommended to have both programs installed in a way that the correct versions of *java* and *mvn* are found in the system path.

In addition, at least 4 GB of free RAM, preferably 8 GB, should be available. The size depends on the number of resources that have to be retrieved from the FHIR server. In a test with ~ 500,000 resources, 4 GB was the lower limit.
